# Netplan Config

The network configuration should be stored here in a `01-netcfg.yaml` file. During the setup of a new Gadget device this file will be used to define the network configuration. 

Documentation on how to create a netplan config file can be found [here](https://people.ubuntu.com/~slyon/netplan-docs/examples/)
